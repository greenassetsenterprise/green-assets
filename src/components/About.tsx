        We're a group of people that did not find any simple tool to help us in
        the rebalancing assets on the Internet. This is a simple tracking the
        assets allocation that help people like us, to be able to review our
        investments, and based on that help protect and grow our wealth.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
        The intend of this tool is not just add shares and compare it to
        allocate our next capital in the next month, but it is a super powerfull
        tool to add any asset classes to compare between it and review where we
        need to add the next portion of money to rebalance our portfolio.

        We're a group of people that did not find any simple tool to help us in
        the rebalancing assets on the Internet. This is a simple tracking the
        assets allocation that help people like us, to be able to review our
        investments, and based on that help protect and grow our wealth.

        The intend of this tool is not just add shares and compare it to
        allocate our next capital in the next month, but it is a super powerfull
        tool to add any asset classes to compare between it and review where we
        need to add the next portion of money to rebalance our portfolio.
